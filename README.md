# divide
Python script for binary search using the divide and conquer approach
In this script:

The binary_search function takes a sorted array arr and a target element target.
It initializes two pointers, left and right, representing the indices of the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array respectively.
It repeatedly divides the search space in half by calculating the middle index (mid).
It compares the target element with the element at the middle index.
If the target element is found, it returns the index of the target element.
If the target element is smaller than the middle element, it continues the search in the left half of the array.
If the target element is larger than the middle element, it continues the search in the right half of the array.
If the target element is not found in the array, it returns -1.
This script demonstrates how the divide and conquer approach is used to efficiently search for an element in a sorted array using the binary search algorithm.
